Mecha Trigger is a first person shooter with a twist: you type all of your commands to control your skyscraper-sized mech in a command line interface. Combat against opponents in online multiplayer or against AI opponents. Fully deck out your mech to take on your foes. Or spectate the battles from above in a helicopter. Mecha Trigger takes advantage of the Oculus Rift to immerse you in the action.

Mecha Trigger earned an Honorable Mention in the 2015 Independent Games Festival student submissions.
