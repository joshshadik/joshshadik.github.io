Jelly Face is a WebGL application that lets you jiggle around celebrity faces. 

It works by mapping vertex positions & velocities to floating-point textures. Based on mouse/touch/vr controller interaction, force is applied in a shader that updates the velocity texture. 

It works with WebVR desktop devices and also is compatible with the Leap Motion sensor.
